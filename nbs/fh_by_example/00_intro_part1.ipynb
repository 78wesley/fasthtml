    "There are lots of non-FastHTML-specific tricks and patterns involved in building web apps. The goal of this tutorial is to give an alternate introduction to FastHTML, building out example applications to show common patterns and illustrate some of the ways you can build on top of the FastHTML foundations to create your own custom web apps. A secondary goal is to have this be a useful document to add to the context of an LLM to turn it into a useful FastHTML assistant - in fact, in some of the examples we'll see this kind of assistant in action, thanks to [this custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-xPqF9SZjM-fasthtml-helper).\n",
