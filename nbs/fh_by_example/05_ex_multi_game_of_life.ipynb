    "## Full Example #4 - Multiplayer Game of Life Example with Websockets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can implement a collaborative website using Websockets in FastHTML. To showcase this, we will use the famous [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), which is a game that takes place in a grid world. Each cell in the grid can be either alive or dead. The cell's state is initially given by a user before the game is started and then evolves through the iteration of the grid world once the clock starts. Whether a cell's state will change from the previous state depends on simple rules based on its neighboring cells' states. Here is the standard Game of Life logic implemented in Python courtesy of ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grid = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]}\n",
    "def update_grid(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n",
    "    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n",
    "    def count_neighbors(x, y):\n",
    "        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n",
    "        count = 0\n",
    "        for dx, dy in directions:\n",
    "            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n",
    "            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]): count += grid[nx][ny]\n",
    "        return count\n",
    "    for i in range(len(grid)):\n",
    "        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n",
    "            neighbors = count_neighbors(i, j)\n",
    "            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n",
    "                if neighbors < 2 or neighbors > 3: new_grid[i][j] = 0\n",
    "                else: new_grid[i][j] = 1\n",
    "            elif neighbors == 3: new_grid[i][j] = 1\n",
    "    return new_grid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a very pooring game if ran since the initial state of everything would stay dead. Therefore, we need a way of letting the user give an initial state before starting the game. FastHTML to the rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def Grid():\n",
    "    cells = []\n",
    "    for y, row in enumerate(game_state['grid']):\n",
    "        for x, cell in enumerate(row):\n",
    "            cell_class = 'alive' if cell else 'dead'\n",
    "            cell = Div(cls=f'cell {cell_class}', hx_put='/update', hx_vals={'x': x, 'y': y}, hx_swap='none', hx_target='#gol', hx_trigger='click')\n",
    "            cells.append(cell)\n",
    "    return Div(*cells, id='grid')\n",
    "\n",
    "@rt('/update')\n",
    "async def put(x: int, y: int):\n",
    "    grid[y][x] = 1 if grid[y][x] == 0 else 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a component for representing the game's state that the user can interact with and update on the server using cool HTMX features such as `hx_vals` for determining which cell was clicked to make it dead or alive. Now, you probably noticed that the HTTP request in this case is a PUT request, which does not return anything and this means our client's view of the grid world and the server's game state will immediately become out of sync :(. We could of course just return a new Grid component with the updated state, but that would only work for a single client, if we had more, they quickly get out of sync with each other and the server. Now Websockets to the rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "Websockets are a way for the server to keep a persistent connection with clients and send data to the client without explictly being requested for information, which is not possible with HTTP. Luckily FastHTML and HTMX work well with Websockets. Simply state you wish to use websockets for your app and define a websocket route:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "...\n",
    "app = FastHTML(hdrs=(picolink, gridlink, css, htmx_ws), ws_hdr=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "player_queue = []\n",
    "async def update_players():\n",
    "    for i, player in enumerate(player_queue):\n",
    "        try: await player(Grid())\n",
    "        except: player_queue.pop(i)\n",
    "async def on_connect(send): player_queue.append(send)\n",
    "async def on_disconnect(send): await update_players()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.ws('/gol', conn=on_connect, disconn=on_disconnect)\n",
    "async def ws(msg:str, send): pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def Home(): return Title('Game of Life'), Main(gol, Div(Grid(), id='gol', cls='row center-xs'), hx_ext=\"ws\", ws_connect=\"/gol\")\n",
    "\n",
    "@rt('/update')\n",
    "async def put(x: int, y: int):\n",
    "    grid[y][x] = 1 if grid[y][x] == 0 else 0\n",
    "    await update_players()\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we simply keep track of all the players that have connected or disconnected to our site and when an update ocurrs, we send updates to all the players still connected via websockets. Via HTMX, you are still simply exchanging HTML from the server to the client and will swap in the content based on how you setup your `hx_swap` attribute. There is only one difference, that being all swaps are OOB. You can find more information on the HTMX websocket extension documentation page [here](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx-extensions/blob/main/src/ws/README.md). You can find a full fledge hosted example of this app [here](https://game-of-life-production-ed7f.up.railway.app/)."

    "## XT objects and HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "These XT objects create an XML tag structure [tag,children,attrs] for `toxml()`. When we call `Div(...)`, the elements we pass in are the children. Attributes are passed in as keywords. `class` and `for` are special words in python, so we use `cls`, `klass` or `_class` instead of `class` and `fr` or `_for` instead of `for`. Note these objects are just 3-element lists - you can create custom ones too as long as they're also 3-element lists. Alternately, leaf nodes can be strings instead (which is why you can do `Div('some text')`). If you pass something that isn't a 3-element list or a string, it will be converted to a string using str()... unless (our final trick) you define a `__xt__` method that will run before str(), so you can render things a custom way.\n",
