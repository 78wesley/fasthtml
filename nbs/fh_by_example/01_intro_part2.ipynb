    "Plain HTML probably isn't quite what you imagine when you visualize your beautiful web app. CSS is the go-to language for styling HTML. But again, we don't want to learn extra languages unless we absolutely have to! Fortunately, there are ways to get much more visually appealing sites by relying on the hard work of others, using existing CSS libraries. One of our favourites is [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). To add a CSS file to HTML, you can use the `<link>` tag. Since we typically want things like CSS styling on all pages of our app, FastHTML lets you add shared headers when you define your app. And it already has `picolink` defined for convenience. As per the [pico docs](https://picocss.com/docs), we put all of our content inside a `<main>` tag with a class of `container`: \n"

A lot of 'Web 1.0' design revolved around ways to use these to do everything we wanted. But why should only *some* elements be allowed to trigger requests? And why should we refresh the *entire page* with the result each time one does? HTMX extends HTML to allow us to trigger requests from *any* element on all kinds of events, and to update a part of the page without refreshing the entire page. It's a powerful tool for building modern web apps.\n",
