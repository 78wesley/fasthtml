    "    rooms.create(id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id', canvas_data=str)\n",

    "async def get(id:int):\n",
    "    room = rooms[id]\n",

    "    return room.canvas_data if room.canvas_data else \"{}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Update the JavaScript to load existing canvas data:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "js = f\"\"\"\n",
    "    var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');\n",
    "    canvas.isDrawingMode = true;\n",

    "### Conclusion: You're a FastHTML Artist Now! üé®üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've just built a sleek, interactive web application using FastHTML. Let's recap what we've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FastHTML allows you to create dynamic web apps with minimal code.\n",
    "2. We used FastHTML's routing system to handle different pages and actions.\n",
    "3. We integrated with a SQLite database to store room information and canvas data.\n",
    "4. We utilized Fabric.js to create an interactive drawing canvas.\n",
    "5. We implemented features like color picking, brush size adjustment, and canvas saving.\n",
    "6. We used HTMX for seamless, partial page updates without full reloads.\n",
    "7. We learned how to deploy our FastHTML application to Railway for easy hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've taken your first steps into the world of FastHTML development. From here, the possibilities are endless! You could enhance the drawing app further by adding features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing different drawing tools (e.g., shapes, text)\n",
    "- Adding user authentication\n",
    "- Creating a gallery of saved drawings\n",
    "- Implementing real-time collaborative drawing using WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you choose to build next, FastHTML has got your back. Now go forth and create something awesome! Happy coding! üñºÔ∏èüöÄ"
